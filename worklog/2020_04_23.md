# Using the robot_localization package

## Position Sensor

**Implement position sensor class**
include/robot_localization/positioning_system.hpp
src/sensors/positioning_system.cpp

**Implement position node**
src/sensors/positioning_system_node.cpps

 - Subscribe to *turtle1/pose* (turtlesim/Pose)
 - Add systematic and random error
 - Publish to *turtle1/sensors/pose* (geometry_msgs/PoseWithCovarianceStamped)
 - Pose is expressed in the *map* frame

## Odometry sensor
**Implement odometry sensor class**
include/robot_localization/odometry.hpp
src/sensors/odometry.cpp

**Implement odometry node**
src/sensors/odometry_node.cpp
 
 - Subscribe to *turtle1/pose* (turtlesim/Pose)
 - Calculate angular and linear velocity
 - Publish to *turtle1/sensors/twist* (geometry_msgs/TwistWithCovarianceStamped)
 - Expressed in *base_link* frame


robot_localization filter output --> /odometry/filtered topic (nav_msgs/Odometry)
Accepts:
 - nav_msgs/Odometry
 - geometry_msgs/PoseWithCovarianceStamped (position and orientation)
 - geometry_msgs/TwistWithCovarianceStamped (linear and angular velocity)
 - sensor_msgs/Imu (orientation, angular velocity and linear acceleration)



Gazebo + model urdf already publishes *nav_msgs/Odometry*:
std_msgs/Header header
string child_frame_id
geometry_msgs/PoseWithCovariance pose
geometry_msgs/TwistWithCovariance twist

From got: pose x, y, z
From robot odometry, imu

**Implementation**
got_node publishes geometry_msgs/PoseWithCovarianceStamped simmilar to position_node

# TODO:
 - Watch robot_localization presentation [https://vimeo.com/142624091]
 - Fuse got pose with odometry and lidar
 - Add imu to sensor fusion
 - Design testing scenarios:
 	-- Launch gazebo + hector slam. Is there any position estimate?
 	-- Launch gazebo + slam + move_base. Is there a position estimate? Re-read move_base docs
 	-- A->B navigation using regular slam + move_base
 	-- A->B navigation but SLAM odometry is the /odometry_filtered from robot_localization
 	-- Re-visit bug algorithm, how can Uppaal be used instead?	
 - launch hector_slam
 - launch go_to_point
 - rosparam des x,y given by Uppaal -- send email to Napalys


# ROSCon video:

## Frames:
 - baselink - attached to robot
 - odom - world fixed - *origin at robot start point* - pose is continuous (no discrete jumps in pose estimate)
 - map - identical to odom frame - 

## One of the filters produces:
  - An odometry msg
  - Transform *world -> base_link* (both frames specified) - assuming wordl frame set to *odom*

  - If world frame set to *map* - take internal tf map -> base_link - lookup tf odom -> base_link - use that to generate map -> odom tf

  - Pose data goes to odom or map
  - Twist data (and IMU) go to base_link
  - Tf does not allow to have 2 parrents for a frame



 - Disable *<publishOdomTF>true</publishOdomTF>* from *-gazebo.xacro*, differential drive plugin as 
 	robot_localization publishes another *odom* fram
 - In *robot_localization.launch* set *base_link_frame = base_foorprint* to adhere to turtblebot urdf

 - Publish got_pose as *geometry_msgs/PoseWithCovarianceStamped* follow position system.cpp example from 
 	[https://github.com/Kapernikov/ros_robot_localization_tutorial]
 	-- rosrun got_node got_position

 - TODO: Get yaw from magnetomemer and publish also as *geometry_msgs/PoseWithCovarianceStamped*

 - Substitute /odom with /odom_noisy - Substituted by enabling robot_localization (which publishes odom frame and disavling gazebo odom frame) + odom topic specified for robot_localization is /odom_noisy

 ## Investigate move_base for turtlebot
 - turtlebot_gazebo/turtlebot3_drive uses same method as *theconstruct*, driving the robot forward unless there's an obstacle from the Lidar.
 - Test hector_slam + odom (no robot_localization published odomframe, *enable publishodom* from urdf.gazebo)
    -- Navigate up to end of map while mapping
    -- hector_slam - good navigation to final point but breaks in the end. Map can have artefacts - obstacles that aren't there
    -- Gmapping - almost perfect navigation but the map is a a little *crooked*

 - Test SLAM+odom_noisy - *diable publishodom* from urdf.gazebo
  - hectr_slam - very goog results by using modified map with more obstacles (maze_mod)

 - Test SLAM+odom_filtered(odom_noisy+got)
 - Test SLAM+odom_filtered(odom_noisy+got+imu)

# Tests:

## Setup:
 - Using move_base with parameters for tb3_burger
 - Not using amcl
 - Map is not saved, move_base subscribed to map in real-time
 - Gazebo is not publishing odom frame
 - Gazebo is publishing */ground_truth* topic
    -- Subscibed by *got_position*
 - odometry_noise.py publishes to */odom* topic
    -- Subscribed by *robot_localization*
 - robot_localization publishes to *odometry/filtered* topic
    -- Subscribed by *move_base*
 - robot_localization published the *odom tf frame*
    -- Used by slam (hector, gazebo) - no odometry topic are used
