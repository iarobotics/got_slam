# Working on the real robot

## Follow the setup instructions from the linorobot stack 
[https://linorobot.org/]

## Setup raspberry Pi 3

 - Install ubiquity imgage [https://downloads.ubiquityrobotics.com/pi.html]
 - *$ ssh ubuntu@ubiquityrobot.local*
 - Default password is "ubuntu" change it ussing *$ passwd*
 - Change hostname: *$ sudo pifi set-hostname NEWHOSTNAME*
 - Reboot
 - *$ ssh ubuntu@NEWHOSTNAME.local*
 - Listen for Wifi: *$ pifi list seen*
 - *$ sudo pifi add MyNetwork password*
 - Reboot
 - Ensure both host and Pi are connected to the same network
 - *ping NEWHOSTNAME.local* or *$ ssh ubuntu@NEWHOSTNAME.local* should work
 - For the main robot **HOSTNAME = robot1**
 - Local wifi network from the Pi is renamed *robot1###*

# Linorobot configs

/home/ubuntu/linorobot_ws/src/linorobot/teensy/firmware/lib/imu/imu_config.h
```cpp
#ifdef USE_GY87_IMU
    #include "MPU6050.h"
    #include "HMC5883L.h"

    #define ACCEL_SCALE 1 / 16384 // LSB/g
    #define GYRO_SCALE 1 / 131 // LSB/(deg/s)
    #define MAG_SCALE 0.92 * MGAUSS_TO_UTESLA // uT/LSB

    MPU6050 accelerometer;
    MPU6050 gyroscope;
    HMC5883L magnetometer;
#endif
```
Does not work properly, seems to be an issue with the MAG library. 
*TODO*: Use HMC5883L.h used in Henrik's Arduino code.
 - Pi: Rename ./teensy/firmware/lib/HMC5883L* to HMC5883L_old
 - Copy Arduino libraries HMC5883L* in the same directory
 - Still doesn't work - *[FATAL] [1455219459.595670]: IMU failed to initialize. Check your IMU connection.*
 - Using regular MPU6050_IMU for now
 - Disable magnetometer readings in launch file:
    linorobot/launch/include/imu/imu.launch
    ```xml
    <param name="use_mag" value="false" />
    ```

/home/ubuntu/linorobot_ws/src/linorobot/teensy/firmware/lib/motor/Motor.cpp
```cpp
//...
    switch (motor_driver)
    {
        case L298:
            //pinMode(pwm_pin_, OUTPUT);
//...
```

## IMU calibration
```bash
roslaunch linorobot minimal.launch

roscd linorobot/param/imu
mv imu_calib.yaml imu_calib0.yaml 
rosrun imu_calib do_calib
# Obtain calibration file imu_calib.yaml

```

 - Integrate got into teensy firmware-------DONE
 - Having trouble publishing it as PosewithCovariance, therefore it's published as geometry_msgs::Point -> /got_teensy
 - Built got_position_pi node on the RPi, listens to /got_teensy and -> got_pose (Posewith Covariance)

## Full session recorded with rosbag

Consider defining a ground truth co compare against
 - got_pose - Position from got
 - odom - odometry filtered
 - raw_odom - raw odometry


**Dev PC: rviz -d navigation-rviz** modifies to vizualize all of the above

## GoT compensator
- Run move_base_publisher together with rosbag to vizualize destitnation points
    -- No need, plotting *move_base_simple/goal* seems to work fine
- Get errro by taking amcl_pose - got_pose
- Set got_error rosparam - make got_position_pi listen and apply 


### Notes:
 - Need keep track where the error happened such as to apply it permanently for that region
 - sort of a dictionary? x,y position + error
 - apply initial offset between got and odometry
 - trigger error when deviation between got and odom is higher that usual - a jump?
    --  account for odometry drift
    

## Using m2wr for bug alg plots
 - m2wr model has very twitchy odometry and the mpa is always inconsistent
 - Using TB3 - must adhere to m2wr specs
    -- scan name in mrw2 is m2wr/laser...
    -- changed scan topic to scan in m2wr wallfollower.py and bug1.py
    -- changed TB3 sensor to 170 degrees and 720 samples such as to adhere to wallfollower.py


 - Get tf frames figure from rosbag
 - Define error vector
    -- Store region as key instead of a fixed point
    -- Region tolerance variable
    -- Plot with different values agains odom or amcl_pose

- Spawn another robot
- Plot got position. odom filtered and got_position_corrected for both
