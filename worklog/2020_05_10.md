# Practicing ros TF

Urdf model is not used solely for simulations but also for publishing complex frames (instead of publishing all manually)

```xml
<param name="robot_description" command="cat $(find robot_description)/urdf/robot.urdf" />

<node name="robot_description" pkg="robot_state_publisher" type="robot_state_publisher"
  respawn="false" output="screen">
  <remap from="joint_states" to="/rbot/joint_states" />
</node>
```

*robot_state_publisher* is only publishing the static transforms (the fixed links).
This means that tf's that depend on variables (e.g. tf of the wheel wrt frame as the robot moves) are unknown to the publisher.

This means that we need encoders/sensors that know the value of the joints
--> use *joint_state_publisher*

**URDF example**
```xml
<joint name="head_pan_servo" type="fixed"> 

<joint name="head_pan_servo" type="continuous"> 
```

therefore the launch file xml looks more like this:
```xml
<param name="robot_description" command="cat $(find robot_description)/urdf/robot.urdf" />

<!-- send fake joint values(otherwise published by controller nodes) - Publish the joints -->
<node name="joint_state_publisher" pkg="joint_state_publisher" type="joint_state_publisher">
  <param name="use_gui" value="TRUE">
</node>

<!-- Publish the tf -->
<node name="robot_description" pkg="robot_state_publisher" type="robot_state_publisher"
  respawn="false" output="screen">
  <remap from="joint_states" to="/rbot/joint_states" />
</node>
```

**Static tf motivation**
By example there are two robots in the world but theres no way to obtain the tf from one to another since they're not connected.
They both have their respective *odom and base_link frames*

One idea is to publish a static tf between the odom frames (since odom frames are also fixed and the same)

```xml
<node pkg="tf" type="static_transform_publisher" name="odom_frames_connection" args="0 0 0 0 0 0 robot1_tf/odom robot2_tf/odom 100" />
```

### Publish odom frame for noisy odometry

robot_localization publishes odom frame using odometry filtered.
To test real-life scenario we need odom published by odometry_noisy.

odometry_noise.py published to /odom topic only.
gazebo does not publish an odom frame but publishes odometry msgs to */ground_truth*

 - Modify odometry_noise.py to publish an odom frame as well
 - Disable robot_localization
    -- roslaunch got_node slam.launch use_robot_localization:=false
    -- odometry_noise is set to publish odom tf if robot_localization is disabled
    -- consult slam.launch for relevant arguments

 - Run hector_slam + noisy odometry frame + go_to_point
 - Same but with move_base
 - Plot difference between ideal path, odometry and slam poseupdate
    -- go_to_point publishes goal position to */goal_position* topic (geometry_msgs/Point)
    -- move_base publishes goal point to */move_base_simple/goal/Pose*
    -- */move_base_simple/goal/Pose* is published only once, need another note that would publish it continuously
    -- Design another node that listens to */move_base_simple/goal/Pose* as callback and then publishes the goal continuously
 
 - Disable frame pubslihing from odometry_noise.py
 - Enable robot_localization (which publishes the odom frame now) - world_frame:odom
 - Same tests as above

 - Same but robot_localization world_frame:map
 - Note: Disable other source of map->odom tf publishing
