HOw to combine slam with Kalman filter?
 - Modify SLAM alg to accept new stream of data
 - Fuse GoT and SLAM
 - Send GoT as odometry
	- Outlite these posiblities and choose one

 - Simulating Got stream of data
	- Use as GPS?
	- GoT provides distance to a known position
	- Henrik's algorith inferes position by projecting estimate onto a circle with a measured dist from the beacon

 - TODO: we receive dist measurement in a ceratin pattern from GoT.
	- Got dist from a ceratin beacon
	- Assume its in 2D
	- If no lign of sight -> measurement distorted, longer than it actually is
 SIMULATION:
 - Define 4 corner points
 - Provide dist to robot from beacon
 - Use Henrik's algortith to infer position
 - INTERFERENCE: How many walls between beacon and robot - each wall adds distortion (e.g) half a meter
	- OR one beacon provides information that is always longer by 1 meter
	- The assume there is always bad readings from one of the beacons

Odometry sends pulse by interrupt function
 - Integrate speed measurement by counting pulses. Missed pulses lead to drift
 - Add noise to wheels and then compare

Teensy code has an inverse low pass filter that takes dynamics out of the account.
Simulate the kin

Set mass and inertia very low and damping very high for a KINEMATIC MODEL

For a swarm of robots only a fraction are equipeed with Lidars.
SIMULATION: e.g 2 with lidar two without

Docking/ Guiding using mechanical systems
Bumper,obstacles to guide the robot in place

- exaplain why use or the case for 2 robots with lidar 

Turn Occupancy grid into some sort of polygonal mapping - poligons with 4 corners

estimates have the same number before and after
H is the Jacobiab/gradient

state modelling heading vector - may have an angle
anglular velocity can be obtain from odometry instead of gyro
Acceleration is measured in locdual coordinayes -> transform to global coordinates

Time derivative of a unit vector has to be orthgonal to the vector itself - reson for R90
