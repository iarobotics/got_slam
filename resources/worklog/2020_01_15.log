        - Make the robot accept movement command (ROS teleop to PWM)
        - Install LIDAR support of RPi

Install rosserial and required packages from masteringrosforrobotprogramming Chapter 11             DONE
    -- Additional requirement ros-kinetic-turtlebot-description (found as turtlebot3 in melodic)
Check serial connection works in WSL                                                                FAIL
        Serial ports can be read by e.g. screen but rosserial doesn't seem to work. Dropping for now
        
        
>>> Going back to Ubuntu Bionic (VM) running ROS melodic:
 - Check rosserial works as expected                                                                 DONE        
 - Install kobuki_description in another workspace and catkin_make, after that make the book code    DONE
 - Compilation is successful but trying to run:
        roslaunch chefbot_bringup robot_standalone.launch
    Throws an error about missing turtlebot_description
 - Install turtlebot_description from source
  
        /// Catkin_make successful (source turtlebot_description in ~/ros_temp)         SUCCESS
        /// roslaunch chefbot_bringup robot_standalone.launch                           SUCCESS
        
 - Upload arduino code to teensy (remove ultrasonic part)
    All nodes run fine but the robot doesn't move when given teleop commands.
    
>>> Perform motor test (book_map/simple_motor_test): Got the following correct mappings:
    ///Left Motor  Pins
    #define INA_2 12
    #define INB_2 11
    #define PWM_2 10

    ///Right Motor Pins
    #define INA_1 26
    #define INB_1 28
    #define PWM_1 30

    #define SPD 100
    
>> Encoder test sample reading (needs a small delay otherwise cannot read):
    -1136	2866  (Left_Wheel(A), Right_Wheel(B))
    
>> IMU test, seems in order as well (values are displayed and are changing if the robot is moved)


>> Robot still doesn't move when given teleop commands

>>>> Replicate the process on the RPi(Assuming the VM is at fault)

Using WSL

Board port: /dev/ttyS5 (for Teensy 3.6)
Need to modify chefbot_bringup/param/board_config with the correct port (as it assumes /de/ttyACM0)

SUCCESS Scenario (Achieved in VM, potentially works in WSL and Rpi as well)
 - Install prerequisites
 - Source install kobuki_description, turtlebot-description (if ros melodic otherwise through apt-get)
 - Use chapter 9 code from rosroboticsprojects.pdf (masteringros.pdf code is broken for teleop)
 - Remove chefbot_gazebo (if ros melodic)
 - Transfer chapter_9 folder into a ros_workspace/src folder and then cd.. && catkin_make
 
  - roslaunch chefbot_bringup robot_standalone.launch       -- Main driver
  - roslaunch chefbot_bringup keyboard_teleop.launch        -- Keyboard teleop
