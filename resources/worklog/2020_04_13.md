# Simulate GoT beacons

## Using ROS tf

Main idea os to publish tf frames at where the beacons are located and then use tf lookup to get distance from published tf to robot:[https://answers.ros.org/question/204248/tf-lookuptransform/] 

 - roslaunch turtlebot3_fake...
 - rosrun tf view_frames
 	-- Generated **frames.pdf** detailing all the published frames
 - rosrun tf tf_echo base_link base scan
 	-- Publishes transfrom as seen in waffle_pi.urdf.xacro. Same translation at [-0.064, 0.000, 0.122]

 - Publish new transfrom at some random point and get distance to base_link
 	-- Create new package my_publish_tf in ~/catkin_turtlebot to publish a point at (5,0,0)
 	-- rosrun my_publish_tf tf_broadcaster
 	-- rosrun tf tf_echo base_link beacon1 (reports translational [5,0,0]) as expected



**Add beacon in xacro**
Tried to create a joint/link combination similar to the one for the imu.
It seems the *xacro can hold only one model* namely that there can be only one base frame and all robot components built around it.
Attempts to define a beacon in xacro e.g at z=5 resulted in the *beacon moving together with the robot*

## Current solution - Publishing multiple transforms

*rosrun my_publish_tf tf_broadcaster* now publishes 5 tf frames corresponding to beacon positions.
As the robot moves it either departs/approaches the frames
In order to behave like the GoT system must find a way to *define beacon range and add measurement noise*


## Get distance in meters from beacon to robot

## Implement Henrik's Arduino code as a ROS node and publish estimated x,y,z to a /ros_topic
