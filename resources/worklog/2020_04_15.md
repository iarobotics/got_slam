 - Beacon transforms published as using *static_transform_publisher*
 - Made a new launch file my_publish_tf->gazebo.launch
    -- Launches gazebo empty world and rviz
    -- Publishes beacon transforms

 - Created *tf_publisher.cpp*
    -- Lookup tranforms from beacons to robot and get distance from all beacons.

 ## Use Henrik's teensy code to get a position estimate

 **DONE**
  Created *my_publish_tf got_position* using 5 beacons. Reported position seems to be correct.

## Next steps

 - Use magnetometer sensor?
 - Implement path following algorithm as on the physical robot (got+ magnetometer)?

 Tests:
 - Line search (mag +got) A->B
 - SLAM A->B (AMCL?) save map then navigate or possible to navigate while doing slam?
 - SLAM A-B but replace odometry with GoT
 - SLAM sensor fusion paper - lidar+got+odometry
